What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
	Before the GPS session I was struggling with the steps in the Git cycle and how they should be implemented. 
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
	We walked through the steps in the cycle and really clarified each one and when it should be done. 
	We also discussed merge conflicts and how to resolve them. This was something that I hadn't seen before, so it was helpful to see how they would occur and what can be done to avoid them.
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
	I asked about how to tell when to push and from what file it should be done within the respository. 
	I also asked how to be able to tell what the remote is when figuring out where to push changes. 
What still confuses you about Git?
	I feel much more confident in Git after my GPS. I wouldn't say I'm confused necessarily, but I'm not sure that I feel confident in my abilities to pull someone elses repository and make changes. I think it will just take more practice.
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
	My first experience was really good. I went in feeling very nervous about the experience because I was not confident in my skills and didn't know what to expect. But pairing with Andrea and having John there to answer questions and provide guidance really felt like we were getting the assistance we needed.
